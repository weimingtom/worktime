WorkTime is an open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) application that targets on business people that want to keep track of their time.
Weather you are working on different projects for different clients or just one project for one company, WorkTime is the application that will track your time.
For now we only support the Android operating system.

## WorkTime for Android ##
It's even more than just an application... It also includes a widget which makes registering time even faster as you can do it right from you Android Home-Screen.

The application provides an interface for managing the tasks, projects and time registrations. It also includes a reporting module to make enhanced reports right on your Android smartphone. You can generate reports based by filtering your time registrations by date (pre-defined date ranges or a custom date range) and by project and task. You can also define the layout of a report (grouped by start date or project) and order descending or ascending (on the start date or the project). And you can define how the totals in the report are calculated (hours-minutes-seconds, days-hours-minutes-seconds (with 24h/day) or days-hours-minutes-seconds (with 8h/day)).

All those custom generated reports can be shared on generation time, which means one-by-one (asked just after the generation of a report), or afterwards in batch mode (from the reporting criteria screen). The applications that can be used to share with are basically Google Docs, Gmail, Mail and any other app that supports sending a file or a bunch of files.

Besides all those modules for managing your data we also provide you with an enhanced preferences module where you can easily define all your wishes on how the application needs to behave for you. It even includes a backup/restore feature (experimental!)



Current features of the application:
  * Widget to start/stop a time registration
  * Notifications in the Android notification bar
  * Backup feature to SD-card to make sure that you never loose your data
  * Manage projects and tasks (create, delete, edit, move,...)
  * Create highly detailed reports for your list of time registrations
  * Export those details to the CSV format (which is supported by all spreadsheet applications included Microsoft Excel)
  * Split time registrations. Let's say you are working on the same task all day, but you want to take a lunch break and forgot to 'Punch Out'. Don't worry, when you get back to work you just choose to split the ongoing (or a previous) time registration. This way don't have to end the previous time registration, start a new one, set the dates and times correct...

Upcoming for the next releases of WorkTime for Android is:
  * On top of the new reporting module you can expect a feature to create garphs out of the reporting result
  * Move a task to another project
  * Schedule backups so you don't have to remember yourself every day that you have to create one. Backup will support:
    * Custom backup naming with vars (numbering, date inclusions,...)
    * Scheduling every hour, day, week, month
    * Keep history backups with a configurable maximum amount of backups to keep
